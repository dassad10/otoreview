Using something like a One-Time-Offer does not have to be a negative thing <a href="https://otosreview.com">OTO Links</a> and does not mean you do not care about your list. When someone first joins your list that is THE time they are MOST passionate about what it is they opted in for. That is why they have just filled out your form and joined your list. Some of those people are going to want to buy a solution right away so by not offering them a solution to buy you can actually be doing some people a disservice. Obviously you don't have to use a <a href="https://otosreview.com">OTO Review</a> everytime you could just present them with a regular offer.
